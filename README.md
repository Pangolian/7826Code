# 7826Code
Timed robot code for FRC team 7826. Many thanks to [manfart2021](https://github.com/manfart2021) for helping us make swerve drive possible.

## Driving
### Swerve Drive
Programmed by [manfart2021](https://github.com/manfart2021)
### Slowing down functions
Programmed by [SuperBoyne](https://github.com/SuperBoyne) and Jetvac2
## Vision
- Initially tried to use Kangaroo + GRIP for processing
- After struggling to get the Kangaroo working for our first competition, we switched to a Limelight 2+ <!-- Picture of the Limelight mount here? -->
- Followed Limelight documentation to create methods for aiming and getting in range
- Used crosshair calibration (instead of estimating distance) for the aiming methods
- Created a vision ring  for testing <!-- Picture of the vision ring here? -->
